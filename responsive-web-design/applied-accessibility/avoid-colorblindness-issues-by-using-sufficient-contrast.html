Increase the background-color lightness value from 35% to 55%, and decrease the color lightness value from 20% to 15%. This improves the contrast to 5.9:1.
-
In practice, the 4.5:1 contrast ratio can be reached by shading (adding black to) the darker color and tinting (adding white to) the lighter color. Darker shades on the color wheel are considered to be shades of blues, violets, magentas, and reds, whereas lighter tinted colors are oranges, yellows, greens, and blue-greens.

    <h2>A Word on the Recent Catnip Doping Scandal</h2>
    <p>
      The influence that catnip has on feline behavior is well-documented, and
      its use as an herbal supplement in competitive ninja circles remains
      controversial. Once again, the debate to ban the substance is brought to
      the public's attention after the high-profile win of Kittytron, a
      long-time proponent and user of the green stuff, at the Claw of Fury
      tournament.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I've stated in the past, I firmly believe a true ninja's skills must
      come from within, with no external influences. My own catnip use shall
      continue as purely recreational.
