<!--
Add an alt attribute to the img tag and set it to an empty string.
-
When an image is already explained with text content or does not add meaning to a page, the img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:

<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">
-->

<h1>Deep Thoughts with Master Camper Cat</h1>
<article>
  <h2>Defeating your Foe: the Red Dot is Ours!</h2>
  <p>To Come...</p>
</article>

<img alt="" src="samuraiSwords.jpeg" />

<article>
  <h2>Is Chuck Norris a Cat Person?</h2>
  <p>To Come...</p>
</article>
